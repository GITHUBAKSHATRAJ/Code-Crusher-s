# Learning Management System (LMS) - Maven Project

## Overview

The Learning Management System (LMS) is a web-based application designed to streamline the management of educational courses, assignments, and student data. The system is built using Java, Maven, and various web technologies, including Servlets, JSP, JSTL, and EL. The LMS allows admins to manage students, courses, and assignments efficiently while providing users (students) with a platform to access their courses and assignments.

## Features

### Admin Features:
As an admin, you can:
1. **Manage Users:**
   - Add new students to the system.
   - View and edit student profiles.
   - Delete student accounts.
2. **Manage Courses:**
   - Create, edit, and delete courses.
   - Assign students to specific courses.
   - View course details such as name, description, and enrolled students.
3. **Manage Assignments:**
   - Create assignments for courses.
   - Set deadlines for each assignment.
   - Grade student assignments and provide feedback.
4. **View Reports:**
   - Generate reports on student performance and course completion.
   - Track student activity and assignment submission status.
5. **Course Enrollment:**
   - Manage student enrollments in various courses.
   - Approve or reject student enrollment requests.

### User Features:
As a user (student), you can:
1. **View Courses:**
   - Browse a list of available courses.
   - View course details, including descriptions and schedules.
2. **Enroll in Courses:**
   - Enroll in courses based on availability or admin approval.
3. **Access Assignments:**
   - View assignments assigned to enrolled courses.
   - Download assignment details and submit work online.
4. **Track Progress:**
   - Check grades for assignments.
   - Monitor the status of course completions.
5. **Submit Assignments:**
   - Upload assignments by the set deadlines.
   - Receive feedback from the admin after grading.
6. **Update Profile:**
   - Update personal information such as contact details and profile picture.

## How It Works

1. **Admin Login:**
   - Admins log in using their credentials to manage users, courses, and assignments.
2. **User Login and Registration:**
   - Users (students) can register and log in to the system to access their courses and assignments.
3. **Course Management:**
   - Admins create courses, which are then available for students to browse and enroll in.
4. **Assignment Management:**
   - Admins can create assignments and assign them to specific courses, which are then visible to the enrolled students.
5. **Student Dashboard:**
   - Once logged in, students are directed to a dashboard where they can view their enrolled courses, assignments, and grades.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Java (Servlets, JSP, JSTL, EL)
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Build Tool:** Maven
- **Database:** MySQL (for storing user data, courses, assignments, etc.)
- **IDE:** Eclipse/IntelliJ IDEA (for development)

## Installation Guide

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lms-project.git
   ```
2. **Build the Project using Maven:**
   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```
3. **Deploy the Application:**
   - Deploy the application to a server such as Tomcat, using the `WAR` file generated in the `target` directory.
4. **Setup Database:**
   - Import the database schema and configure the database connection in `web.xml` or through application settings.
5. **Access the Application:**
   - Open the browser and navigate to the deployed URL to access the LMS.
